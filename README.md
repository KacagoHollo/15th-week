# Login form with authorization - frontend

Creating a form with the options of sign up, log in and signout.
The logged in user is able to save to-dos to his profile page.
The password is hashed, the user datas are saved to localstorage and sessionstorage.

This is the frontend part of the app, and being made by React. For more about React and its usage see the README.md at the src folder.

The App works perfectly with the backend side: https://github.com/KacagoHollo/15th-week-express.
